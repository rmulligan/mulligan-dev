I build research‑grade systems that make model behavior inspectable and testable.
My current focus is the **introspection gap**, when a model acts on a state it won’t admit.

If you work on interpretability, evaluations, or alignment, I’d love feedback or collaboration.

## Support and Hiring
I am open to research sponsorships, collaborations, and hiring conversations.
If you want to support this work or explore a role, the best way to reach me is email.
