# Lilly Briefing Pack

## Summary
Lilly is a research system that measures when a model acts on an internal state it will not admit.
The core finding is a framing‑dependent suppression of self‑report, which has direct implications
for evaluation integrity.

## Core findings
1. Framing can flip self‑report while behavior stays stable.
2. Suppression weakens at 14B compared to 8B baselines.
3. Probe choice changes the measured size of the effect.
